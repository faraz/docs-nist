The information system:

<ol type="a">
  <li>Provides audit record generation capability for the auditable events defined in AU-2 a. at [Assignment: organization-defined information system components];</li>
  <li>Allows [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] to select which auditable events are to be audited by specific components of the information system; and</li>
  <li>Generates audit records for the events defined in AU-2 d. with the content defined in AU-3.</li>
</ol>					 

##<a id='supplemental'></a>Supplemental Guidance

Audit records can be generated from many different information system components. The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to be generated. These events are typically a subset of all events for which the information system is capable of generating audit records.
